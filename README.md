# Vacation Ideas

## About the Project
This mini project was given while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user can go to this site and add info on potential vacation destinations. The info is stored in a card that appears once the form is submitted. The nav bar also has links to real vacation sites to help plan. This was an outside of class project we were able to work on and use to practice the skills we learned during the course. 

You can see the live site -> [Vacation](https://brandi-jeff.github.io/vacation-ideas/)
