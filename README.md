# [Vacation Ideas]( https://brandi-jeff.github.io/Destinations/)
## About the Project
The goal is help you organize your ideas about future vacations by saving your favorite destinations ideas all in one place! Just fill out the form then browse through your
submissions to find your next adventure. Then, click a helpful link in the navbar menu to begin your planning. Happy travels! 

## Started from the Bottom, Now we're Here
This mini project was given while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We were given a template to look at, and then told to remake the page as we learned new concepts. 
<br>

The starting point in the template below was a very simple design that we could take an make our own. 
- The idea was to obtain information from a form, store that information, and then return it to the user as a dynamically created card using Javascript. 
- The cards should have edit and remove buttons for the user. 
    - When edit button is clicked, the user should be able to change the fields they want to change and the card will update and/or stay the same based on what was/was not changed.
    - When the remove button is clicked, the entire card is removed from the list.
- The images should autogenerate from an API based on the destination name. 
    - I used the Unsplash API.

## Back to the Future
There are few things I didn't get to implement to make this a fully functional site. Below are a couple things I think would improve the page and may come back to in the future
- Add back end so user can login and save their cards
- Make site responsive on most screen sizes
- Update dialog box to catch if user clicks cancel
- Update remove button to prompt user to confirm they want to remove
